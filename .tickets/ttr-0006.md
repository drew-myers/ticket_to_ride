# GitHub GraphQL Client

Implement a GraphQL client wrapper for GitHub API.

## Description

Create a reusable GraphQL client for GitHub API operations.

Implement in `src/github/client.rs`:
- `GitHubClient` struct holding reqwest client and token
- `GitHubClient::new(token)` constructor
- `GitHubClient::query<T>()` method for GraphQL queries
- `GitHubClient::mutate<T>()` method for GraphQL mutations
- Proper error handling for API errors
- Rate limit awareness (at minimum, surface rate limit errors clearly)

Use the GitHub GraphQL endpoint: `https://api.github.com/graphql`

Required headers:
- `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
- `User-Agent: ttr`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Can execute GraphQL queries
- [ ] Can execute GraphQL mutations
- [ ] Handles API errors with clear messages
- [ ] Surfaces rate limit errors
- [ ] Proper request headers set
