# Dependency References in Issue Body

Render ticket dependencies as issue references in the GitHub issue body.

## Description

When a ticket has dependencies (`deps: [other-1, other-2]`), include them in the issue body.

### Format

At the bottom of the issue body, before the footer:

```markdown
---
**Depends on:** #45, #67, #89

---
<sub>Synced from ticket `nw-5c46`</sub>
```

### Logic

1. For each dep ID in ticket.deps:
   - Look up the dep ticket
   - If it has `external-ref: gh-{N}`, use `#{N}`
   - If not synced, use the ticket ID as text: `ttr-0003 (not synced)`

2. Only include section if there are dependencies

3. On update, regenerate the depends section (deps might have been synced since last push)

### Edge Cases

- Circular dependencies: just render what's there, cycles are a ticket problem not a sync problem
- Missing dep ticket: warn but continue, show "unknown-id (not found)"

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dependencies rendered as `#N` references in issue body
- [ ] Unsynced deps shown with ticket ID and "(not synced)" note
- [ ] Section only included when deps exist
- [ ] Updates regenerate deps section with current state
