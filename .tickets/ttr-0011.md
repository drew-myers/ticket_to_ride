# Status Command

Implement `ttr status` to show sync state of tickets.

## Description

Add a status command that shows the current sync state without making changes.

### Output Format

```
$ ttr status

Tickets: 12 total
  Unsynced:     3  (will create new issues)
  Synced:       8  (up to date)  
  Modified:     1  (will update)
  Conflicts:    0  (modified outside ttr)

Unsynced:
  ttr-0001  [epic]    ttr MVP - Core Push Functionality
  ttr-0002  [task]    Project Setup and Cargo Configuration
  ttr-0003  [task]    Configuration Parsing

Modified:
  ttr-0040  [task]    Update API documentation (body changed)
```

### Logic

For each ticket:
1. No external-ref → "Unsynced"
2. Has external-ref, fetch issue:
   - Marker missing → "Conflict"
   - Content matches → "Synced"
   - Content differs → "Modified"

### Performance Consideration

Fetching every issue is slow. Consider:
- Batch GraphQL query for multiple issues
- Cache issue state locally (future enhancement)
- `--quick` flag that skips GitHub fetch (just shows external-ref presence)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Shows count summary by category
- [ ] Lists unsynced tickets
- [ ] Lists modified tickets with what changed
- [ ] Detects conflicts (issues modified outside ttr)
- [ ] Works without network for basic info (--quick mode optional)
